# Solo Checkpoints
This repository contains sample solutions for all of the CSE 210 solo checkpoints.

This is a way to implement these programs, but it is not the only way.

You are welcome to use this repo to help you finish a program if you get stuck, but you should exert your very best efforts before turning to this code for help.

## Organization
Each assignment is contained in its own folder.

There is a launch.json file that allows you to switch between projects for debugging.
